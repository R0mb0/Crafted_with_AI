## Story of this repository

"I previously created a "[Not Made By AI](https://github.com/R0mb0/Not_made_by_AI)" badge. But after working with AI, I realized that focusing strictly on 'Human-made' in the professional world is anachronistic, as many tasks would no longer be economically sustainable without it. That's why I decided to create a new badge to celebrate the collaboration between humans and AI.

## Common Questions

<details>
  <summary> 
   
### Why did you use HTML to draw the badge?
  
  </summary>  

I'm not skilled with drawing apps, and I had limited free time to create the badge. (╥﹏╥) So, I preferred to use a familiar tool instead of learning a new one.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Why should I include this badge in my work?
  
  </summary>  

This badge is a form of self-declaration that you used AI to assist in your work. While some people omit this fact to appear more skilled than they actually are, displaying this badge is a sign of intellectual honesty. It shows humility, acknowledging that you don't overestimate your abilities and that you might not fully understand every single line of the generated code.

### What do you think about AI?
  
  </summary>  

I think AI is a fantastic tool for work, but it should not be used as a replacement for the effort required to learn something. I see AI as an assistant to simplify my work, not a tool to delegate my tasks. 

The only way to grow as a person and a professional is to spend time learning and not always look for the easiest way to do everything. Gaining experience is the most important thing. (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
